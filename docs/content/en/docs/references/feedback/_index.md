## Skaffold Feedback Sessions
The Skaffold team actively incorporates user feedback as the product evolves.
We are looking to chat with developers like you to learn about how you use Skaffold and
anything we can do to make it better suit your needs.

If youâ€™re interested, please provide your contact information below by filling in
[Skaffold feedback form](https://forms.gle/J5h567ncypY2ziq49).

We'll reach out to schedule a one-hour hangouts session at a time convenient for you. Providing your information does not guarantee that we will contact you. 


No preparation is needed on your part.
Plus, you'll get the chance to help build something you'll love and a token of our appreciation once participation  is complete!

If at any time you wish to opt out of any communications from Skaffold team, please fill our [opt-out form](https://forms.gle/cnfCXotenyUtF92w6)
